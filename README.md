# Cryptomedia subgraph

> All cryptomedia NFTs in one subgraph

More about subgraphs and The Graph protocol you can find [here](https://thegraph.com/docs/introduction).

### Deliverables for the NFT subgraph:

- Query created NFTs by address
- Query owned NFTs by address
- Query NFT metadata by NFT
- Query per platform
- Have all platforms smart contracts integrated 

The challenge is to be able to pull from:
- [x] Rarible
- [x] Superrare
- [x] Known Origin
- [x] Nifty Gateway
- [x] OurZora.com
- [ ] WithFoundation.com
- [x] dontbuymeme.com

And having an open GitHub so anyone can PR new smart contracts associated with those platforms.
